the complete design and execution of a Chrome Extension that monitors users’ online behavior by tracking the time they spend on different websites, categorizing this time into productive and unproductive segments, and visually displaying the information through an engaging and user-friendly dashboard. This assignment tackles a highly relevant and practical issue in today’s digital landscape—our reliance on browsers and online platforms for nearly all facets of life, ranging from work and academic studies to social interaction and leisure. Given the enormous amount of time spent online daily, it is easy to lose sight of how much time is used productively compared to wasted on distractions. Although many applications exist for desktop and mobile devices that seek to manage screen time or boost productivity, a lightweight browser-integrated tool that functions entirely in the background without requiring constant user engagement is uncommon and highly beneficial. Task 4 seeks to address this need by developing a Chrome extension that can be installed and utilized within the browser, gathering time usage data quietly and providing users with actionable insights based on their actual browsing habits. The system comprises three main components: the Chrome extension itself (which consists of a manifest file, background script, content scripts, and popup interface), a data visualization dashboard created as a separate HTML page utilizing Chart. js, and the local storage system that effectively and securely manages and retains all usage data.
The essential logic of this Chrome extension is executed in a background service worker, which operates persistently (in accordance with Chrome’s Manifest V3 guidelines) and responds to browser events such as tab activations, tab modifications, and changes in window focus. Each time the user opens a new tab or shifts away from an existing one, the extension records the timestamp of the action and computes the time difference from the last recorded timestamp to assess how long the user has been on the current website. It subsequently analyzes the URL to extract the domain name (e. g. , youtube. com, github. com, stackoverflow. com, etc. ) and saves the total time spent on that domain in Chrome’s local. storage API. This API facilitates persistent client-side storage, guaranteeing that the user’s activity data remains accessible even after browser restarts and page reloads. Notably, the extension is designed to function offline and entirely locally, which not only simplifies development by eliminating the need for backend integration but also builds user trust and confidentiality by ensuring that no personal data is sent to external servers. The storage model is crucial to maintaining performance and simplicity while ensuring that adequate data granularity is preserved to enable meaningful analysis.
In addition to the time-tracking feature, the extension offers a small popup interface that allows users to access a full-screen analytics dashboard. The popup consists of a minimal HTML page featuring a single button marked “View Dashboard. ” Upon clicking this button, a new browser tab opens that loads dashboard. html, the specialized reporting and visualization component of the project. The dashboard itself is a static web page specifically designed to dynamically retrieve all stored usage data from Chrome’s local storage and present it in a visually comprehensible format utilizing the Chart. js JavaScript library. Due to Chrome’s Content Security Policies (CSP), external scripts from CDNs cannot be directly loaded. As a result, the Chart. js library is bundled locally and referenced via a relative path to ensure compliance with Chrome extension guidelines. The dashboard retrieves all monitored domains and their respective time values, organizes them into a chart-appropriate format, and displays them as a bar chart where each bar corresponds to a website domain. The chart is color-coded: productive sites such as github. com, leetcode. com, and w3schools. com are represented with blue or green colors, whereas unproductive or distracting sites like youtube. com, facebook. com, or instagram. com are indicated in red or pink hues. This color distinction gives users an immediate visual insight into the balance or imbalance of their online behavior. Below the chart, the dashboard also shows a productivity summary that includes total time spent browsing, time allocated to productive versus unproductive sites, and a productivity score. This score is calculated as a percentage based on the proportion of productive time to the entire tracked time. This overarching metric can serve as a daily performance measure and assist users in recognizing trends in their time usage. From a software architecture perspective, the project skillfully integrates the frontend, background logic, and data storage in a modular and manageable manner. The implementation of asynchronous functions, event listeners, and persistent storage highlights practical applications of JavaScript within a browser context. Additionally, the meticulous adherence to Chrome’s Manifest V3 structure guarantees compatibility with contemporary versions of Chrome and affords a secure, lightweight extension experience.
One of the remarkable features of Task 4 is its practical applicability. It serves not just as a showcase of technical expertise, but as a tool with real-world relevance in daily living. In an era where digital distractions pose significant challenges to productivity—especially for students, professionals, and remote workers—this extension functions as a digital reflection, indicating precisely how users allocate their online time. It enables users to manage their habits without necessitating changes to their browsing or device usage. Regarding expandability, this initiative is very adaptable. Future enhancements might involve the capability to personalize the lists of productive/unproductive domains, establish time restrictions for non-productive sites, create downloadable usage summaries in CSV or PDF formats, link with cloud-based systems for multi-device tracking, or even send alerts to the user when they exceed a certain amount of time on attention-diverting websites.
